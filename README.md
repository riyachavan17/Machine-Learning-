Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction

Developed a machine learning model to predict the success of a bank's marketing campaign.
Utilized Random Forest as the best-performing model, optimizing it for accuracy.
Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and handled multicollinearity.
Applied Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, tuning models with GridSearchCV.
Evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
Used Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for analysis and visualization.
